## Install instructions
polychrom runs off the openmm system for molecular dynamics simulation. Official installation instructions for openmm are here: 
http://docs.openmm.org/latest/userguide/application.html#installing-openmm
If you have Anaconda or one of its derivatives like Miniconda already installed, and your GPU drivers are also installed (or you intend to use CPU), installation should be a simple: 
`conda install -c conda-forge openmm`

Once you openmm, there are a few other python dependencies you may need. Most of these are listed in the 'requirements.txt'. Python will also tell you if any packages are missing and you can simply pip install them then. 

If you do plan to use a CUDA GPU, you will need to make sure your openmm install specifies the matching cudatoolkit.
An NVIDIA "Titan X Pascal" or "Titan V" are currently the benchmark graphics cards.  

## Mirny lab polymer simulation library

It keeps improving, but at this point it is as production ready as openmm-polymer ever was. 
Hence, openmm-polymer is being deprecated in favor of this library. 
While it is not backwards compatible, the conversion is easy and intuitive. 
Note that openmm-polymer is not updated anymore, except for critical bugs. 

Some autogenerated docs are here (still in development): 
https://polychrom.readthedocs.io/en/latest/

It has a new storage format that is described here: 
https://github.com/mirnylab/polychrom/blob/master/examples/storage_formats/hdf5_reporter.ipynb and is discussed in the documentation as well. 

New loop extrusion example code is here: 
https://github.com/mirnylab/polychrom/tree/master/examples/loopExtrusion . It is a good starting point for loop extrusion simulations. 

Simplest example simulation that does nothing, which is a good starting point for novel simulations: 
https://github.com/mirnylab/polychrom/blob/master/examples/example/example.py

And for backwards compatibility with analysis routines, we have legacy reporter
https://github.com/mirnylab/polychrom/blob/master/examples/storage_formats/legacy_reporter.ipynb
and polychrom.polymerutils.load function that is backwards compatible with both new and old style 
format. https://github.com/mirnylab/polychrom/blob/master/polychrom/polymerutils.py#L22
