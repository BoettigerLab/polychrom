## This is a library in development. 

It is replacing openmm-polymer. While it is not backwards compatible, 
the conversion is easy and intuitive. It has a set of new features that are 
not being backported into openmm-polymer, except for the very critical bugs. 

Some autogenerated docs are here (still in development): 
https://polychrom.readthedocs.io/en/latest/

It has a new storage format that is described here: 
https://github.com/mirnylab/polychrom/blob/master/examples/storage_formats/hdf5_reporter.ipynb

New loop extrusion example code is here: 
https://github.com/mirnylab/polychrom/tree/master/examples/loopExtrusion

Simplest example file is here: 
https://github.com/mirnylab/polychrom/blob/master/examples/example/example.py

And for backwards compatibility with analysis routines, we have legacy reporter
https://github.com/mirnylab/polychrom/blob/master/examples/storage_formats/legacy_reporter.ipynb
and polychrom.polymerutils.load function that is backwards compatible with both new and old style 
format. https://github.com/mirnylab/polychrom/blob/master/polychrom/polymerutils.py#L22
