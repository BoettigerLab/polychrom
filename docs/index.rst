Welcome to the documentation for the polychrom package
======================================================

Polychrom is a package for setting up, performing and analyzing polymer simulations of chromosomes. 
The simulation part is based around VJ Pande's OpenMM library - a GPU-assisted framework for general molecular dynamics simulations. 
The analysis part is written by the mirnylab.
