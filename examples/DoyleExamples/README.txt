The code presented here complements publication by Doyle et al., "Chromatin loops as modulators of enhancer-promoter interactions". 

Currently we present the code which performs polymer simulations and generates a set of 3D conformations: sampleSimulation.py
Parameter values are defined in the text of the code. 

To obtain contact maps from conformations saved by sampleSimulation.py, please use the funciton openmm-polymer.contactmaps.pureMap(). 

Later these files will be updated to automate calculation of the contact frequency ratio (as defined in the manuscript).
