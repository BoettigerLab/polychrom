    ### -----------Adding forces and forcekits  ---------

    # Many forces are independent from each other, and can be just added to the system

    # However, in some cases some forces go together as a group and have shared properties
    # For example, both polymer chain and polymer stiffness demand a set of chains
    # And exceptions to the nonbonded force should be added for all polymer bonds
    # Forcekits can explicitly take care of such dependencies
    # While still providing flexibility of choosing which forces to use

    # This is an example of a standalone force that implements spherical confinement
    # This force does not depend on any other forces and is just added alone
    sim.add_force(forces.spherical_confinement(sim, density=0.85, k=1))
    # Specifying density is more intuitive than radius
    # k is the slope of confinement potential, measured in kT/mon
    # set k=5 for harsh confinement
    # and k = 0.2 or less for collapse simulation

    # This is an example of a forcekit that intorudces dependencies between polymer chain related forces
    # This forcekit takes chains as a second argument; in the same format as openmmlib
    # It then takes a function to initialize polymer bond force, and a dictionary of parameters
    # Then the same for angleForce and for the nonbondedForce

    # Note that if you defined your own force of a certain type (e.g. your own polymer bond force)
    # Then you can simply sideload it using lambda functions ad in example below
    #
    # myforce = openmm.customExternalForce(.......)
    # forcekits.polymerChains(...,
    # bondForceFunc = lambda x:myforce,
    # bondForceKwargs = {}
